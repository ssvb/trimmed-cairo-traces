This directory contains a collection of traces that represent applications
in the wild. In particular, they represent behaviour that someone thought
worthy of further study and analysis!

To capture a trace:
$ cairo-trace --profile application [args...]
This will produce a application.$pid.lzma file.  If you think it is
interesting add it to this repository, giving it a short but descriptive
name, and add a note here explaining what the trace captures.

To replay traces:
Use cairo/perf/cairo-perf-trace. By default cairo-perf-trace will loop
over all traces within cairo/perf/cairo-traces for all test targets. To run
against a subset specify a series of traces on the command line and use the
CAIRO_TEST_TARGET environment variable to filter the target. For example,
CAIRO_TEST_TARGET=xlib ./cairo-perf-trace firefox.

Guidelines
----------
Initial thoughts...

1. Nothing obscene, or otherwise unsuitable for viewing by children or in the
workplace - please be considerate to others. The trace should also respect
copyright where appropriate. Even though the content is not usually visible
during a replay, it is not acceptable to distribute such material via
freedesktop.org.

2. Each trace must be "representative of a significant use". The goal is a
set of traces that capture the behaviour of real applications during active
sessions. (We must guard against the tests becoming too artificial as that
is better served by purpose-written micro-benchmarks.)

3. For practical reasons (i.e. continuous performance testing), each trace
should neither be profligate in the resources consumed nor the duration of
the run. However, I'm loathe to exclude tests simply because they take too
long or can not be run on tiny machines. (Instead, I plan to create subset
of tests that have been truncated to run within 60s on a 2GHz Intel Core2.)

4. If the application significantly improves such that the current trace
is no longer representative of that application, it must be replaced. This
is to ensure that we do not try to optimise for "historically broken
behaviour".

Benchmarks
----------
The benchmarks are a set of trimmed traces that should run in a reasonable
timeframe (I'm aiming for <10 seconds on a 2GHz Core2 with cairo-image, using
./csi-trace --trim=10). The idea here is that this allows us to quickly
determine a representative metric without running the whole suite -- and is
useful for the casual user. The full traces are kept as they will exercise
corner cases much more thoroughly and are not compromised by the conversion.

To run the benchmark subset, use cairo-perf-trace benchmark.

firefox-talos-gfx - The synthetic firefox benchmark (identical to
                    firefox-talos-gfx-20090702) that exercise the core renderer.
